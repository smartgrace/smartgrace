* Hi there! I'm Grace, a statistician with over 3 years of expertise in data analytics, statistical modeling, and machine learning. I possess extensive programming skills and hands-on experience dealing with real-world data. Currently, I am actively looking for a Data Analytics position and am available to start working anytime! 

* Over the past few years, I've been immersed in Data Analytics, using R and SAS in hands-on projects spanning IT, healthcare, economics, products, natural science, and sociology. My work involves everything from data exploration to model development, final validation, and presenting findings to non-statisticians. I'm well-versed in Python, R, and SAS, holding both Base and Advanced SAS certificates. Additionally, I'm proficient in SQL, EXCEL, JAVA, and skilled in data visualization tools like TABLEAU and Power BI.

* My journey into the world of data began with the Statistics for Researchers course at UGA in 2015. This experience ignited my passion for working with data, leading me to pursue a Master's in Statistics at NC State. The program provided rigorous academic training, enhancing my foundations in statistical modeling, data analysis, and machine learning. I also served as a statistical consultant with the Environment Protection Agency, improving regression models and conducting invaluable research with Prof. Brooke Alhanti on a healthcare project for a pharmatutical company from Costa Rica. These experiences sparked my interest in applying statistics to real-world data analytics.

* In March 2018, I launched my professional career as a statistician at Atrium Health, focusing on protocol review, data manipulation, and statistical analysis. I managed diverse projects across different departments, uncovering my true passion for data analytics. Meanwhile, my literature background complemented the role, allowing me to be rigorously logical and excel in interpretation, facilitating communication with investigators.

* Eager to broaden my research scope and strengthen my data analytics expertise, I left Atrium Health to pursue a Ph.D. in Statistics. Despite initially securing two offers, unforeseen challenges such as COVID-19 and family issues made me to replan my career trajectory. Undeterred, I proactively recharged myself by enrolling in online courses on Coursera and Data Bootcamp. These experiences have not only sharpened my skills but also kept me abreast of the latest industry developments. Now, having successfully navigated these challenges, I am well-prepared to re-enter the job market with renewed focus and dedication.

* I am sharing projects & coding work here, feel free to explore them and have fun!
